# hgnc.mcp: MCP Server for HGNC Gene Nomenclature Resources

Provides tools for accessing HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee)
gene nomenclature resources. Includes functions for searching,
resolving, and validating gene symbols using local cached data and the
HGNC REST API. Also provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that
exposes these tools to AI assistants and other MCP-compatible clients.
The HGNC database is described in Braschi et al. (2019)
[doi:10.1093/nar/gky930](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky930) .
